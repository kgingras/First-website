  I would love to have the code for my projects on Github, however, I would rather not take any risks of having other students finding and using my code. If that were to happen, I could possibly recieve an honor code violation. If you would like to see some of the code for the projects listed under the "PROJECTS" tab, than I would be happy to share it over email.
