<h1>Keith Gingras</h1>
  <h2>Reliable, Team Player, and Methodical</h2>

  <div id = "para">
    The three words above are what I would use to describe myself.
    I am reliable because of how I can get things done when they are asked to be finished. In all of my previous jobs I have worked as part of a team that has learned to be productive and efficient at the given task. Lastly, I chose methodical because once I get started on a project I work hard until it is finished.

      I am currently attending the University of Michigan working toward a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science with a minor in Chemistry.

      Other than spending time at my computer I enjoy being outdoors. Spending time with family and friends fishing and target practice is one of my favorite things to do. I also enjoy playing basketball, tennis, and golf.
